The problem you are outlining is unique because this is an issue that exists in every country yet many people don't know how to solve this problem. I myself have had to do research to learn about how to dispose of e waste, I could have used your app! I would have likes to see more evidence of why it is bad for the environment. You mention certain materials that are particular harmful, I am very curious to why they are harmful and how. I think this would help make your case more if you elaborated on what people are trying to prevent. 

","
Your app could benefit from a faster method to find e waste removal organizations. I would think that the main interest of people choosing this app would be to find someone that would take the waste. It seems that you identify e waste and what it is before prompting to find a remover. If the app user had the ability to locate a removal spot first, I think that the user would be more likely to utilize the app. I do like your layout and color choices and the addition of a quiz is fun. 

","
Your business model would be more convincing if you elaborated more on the market research portion. I am curious to know exactly how much e waste is out there. A lot of people get new phones every year or so, what do they do with the old phone? Are phones a big issue or is it computers? It would help to establish exactly where the waste is coming from and what it is. You have such an interesting idea with this app and it is very original and useful, it would help to have more facts and data to back up just how useful the app really is.
","Your pitch was convincing because it did present the issue in a fun and approachable manner. You didn't over emphasize the reasons that you created the app it is just a fun approach that introduces your topic. Once again, I think it would be helpful to introduce the main reasons behind creating the app but overall the pitch video works. If I just saw this pitch video out of context I would be very intrigued to know more. ","I love your idea because it connects people with something that is often not thought about yet very important! Bravo team for thinking outside the box and finding a unique problem that needs to be addressed.

The problem you are outlining would be more convincing if we had specific information including facts or statistics. The app seems to be well connected to your specific community so it would be helpful to know some of vital information that is needed about the community it is trying to help. How will this app specifically help the kids that need it most? How are you verifiying that the information within the app directly aligns with what is specifically needed by kids in middle school? Just a little more information and background would help make the argument stronger and more aligned with your UN development goal. 
","
You demonstrated a strong understanding of app construction and coding. Your demo video illustrates that the app has quite a few functions and a lot of practical information. I especially like how there are multiple elements to your app, it doesn't just do one thing but multiple things that willl keep the user entertained while being educated. Well done with this demo video! I could see a student using this app. 

",,"Your pitch was convincing because it really helped the viewer empathize with the problems that students are facing in your community. However, I think the pitch would video would be stronger if you were able to make it even more personal or tell just a little bit more about the problems faced in your community. I'm sure you have very personal reasons why this app speaks to you, it would help your pitch video if you shared some of those particular reasons. Sometimes, being 'sappy' or just personal helps to make the case for why an app or product is important. 
","I really like your submission a lot! I can tell that you spent a lot of time really thinking about how to help students in your community and created a very positive product. This app really does stand out from others in that you are creating a product that not only benefits your community but benefits your peer group within your community. This level of thought demonstrates a strong sense of maturity amongst your team. Congratulations on creating such an impactful and powerful app!

I love that your app is sort of like an onboarding app that helps users feel more comfortable in a new place. I see how your app aligns to the SDG peace, giving people access to know what their legal rights definitely fits in with this. However perhaps you could provide some more facts or details about the problems people normally face when they arrive in the US? ",Your app has a ton of features and resources! You did a great job creating an interface that is easy to navigate and I love your logo and color scheme! It's very cool that you used the Yandex Translate feature. I have never seen a team use that feature before. Overall it looks like you really know what you are doing and are well on your way to become great coders. One tip I have to offer is to find ways to use less screens. This will make your app faster when clicking on different things. There is an option in App Inventor that allows you to make a component visible or not. In the blocks you can set the visibility to true or false. This allows you to hide components when you are not using them and show other components instead. Overall I am very impressed with the quality of your code. Keep up the good work!,"Great job on your business plan! I think it is very appealing that your app is free to download and can be used by anyone. I also love that you got specific stories from people to inform the features to build. However, you mention expanding your app outside of Long Island and into other US cities. Right now you have donations as your business model. However, coding your app in another programming language, adding new features, and getting the word out about it is going to take a lot of time and effort! Additionally you may encounter fees and costs along the way, like getting your app into various app stores, supporting large amounts of traffic on your app, or needing new computers or phones to test on. Since you are currently full time students, working on this app may take away free time you have to get a job, so you may also want to eventually pay yourselves. It's awesome to keep your app free, but can you think of a more sustainable model for all these future costs? Perhaps you can estimate how much money you will make off of donations and how much money you think you will need to make sure you can support your app. Then, you can evaluate if you are going to make enough money off of donations or if you need to come up with another plan.","I love that your video shows your pitch side by side next to the application. I think your pitch would be even stronger if you talked about the common issues that immigrants face on Long Island and how your app addresses and solves those. Do your users typically have issues getting around or finding stores to shop at? You mentioned that your features were informed by stories you got from people. Your pitch would be even more convincing if you included either a short version of some of those stories or mentioned those stores. Overall, great job!","Like I said above, I really love that your app put everything a person needs into one place. There are a few features that are convenient for your app to have as a mobile application, such as the maps, the locations of the store and the bus and train schedules. However there are already many apps for services like these. Could you think of a few mobile features that would be completely unique to your app? What if users could connect with each other, or put postings of jobs or opportunities, sort of like craigslist? With that being said, there are many advantages to keeping an app simple and making sure all the features work well, which you have done a great job of! Keep up the awesome awesome work! Congratulations!!"
vdiet-by-juxtapose,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,3,5,3,4,4,4,Your app aligns clearly with the SDG you chose because you identified a problem within your country that is critical and needs attention and provided a solution. You provided detailed statistics and information that helped to make the case for your app. I also like how you provide not one but three different solutions to such a big problem. If users are able to benefit from one or all three solutions they are more likely to succeed. Well done!,"The most impressive functionality of your app is that you have so many different options for the user to sort through. They can set reminders, track how many calories they would intake or just gain useful knowledge. From your demonstration video it was hard to tell exactly how all components worked together. I would recommend that you used a more thorough demonstration video next time to really show off the functionality. ","Some of the best aspects of your business plan are that you provide detailed market research and identify your potential competitors. This really helps see where your app falls on the market and how many users it can potentially gain. Your plan is very detailed and provides the reader with a thorough understanding of your app. In addition you provide helpful information concerning projections and how the app could potentially grow. One thing I would like to see elaborated upon more is your future projections. You claim that you will have 4k downloaders in the first year with a 75% retention rate. I would like to see more evidence to how you have obtained these projections.
","Your pitch was convincing because you obviously feel very strongly about the problem you are addressing. However, your pitch was a little long and could have been more to the point. To identify one aspect, why did the young woman collapse on the stairs? I think it would help if we saw the app actually helping this individual. All in all, a very entertaining pitch video!","
The part I loved the most about your submission is that you brought about such a positive and well thought out solution to a very big problem. The best part about your app is the multiple focus areas of the app. A user could really benefit in multiple ways, not just one which is very helpful for someone that is starting to be healthy from square one. I would like to know if you or your family are currently using the app? This is an app that I would use and recommend to individuals that were trying to get healthy. Well done team!!!

Your app aligns clearly with the SDG you chose because
it is focused on educating citizens on their rights and how they can go about it when it i has been violated. I also think it might fit equality SDG as well. Your case be strong if you provide some statistics on how these rights are violated in your community. Great idea for an app! 
","
You demonstrated a strong understanding of how to make a simple user friendly design of your app. It is also great to be able to directly call the right office to report specific issues. 

",,"
Your pitch would be more convincing if you showed some statistics on how these are rights are being violated in your community and also if you app included some more information about the rights each citizen has. It is great that they can contact the authorities when there is an issue, but some people might not even know that there is an issue. It will be great if the app can include some information about actual rights.

The part I loved the most about your submission is
how well spoken each of you were and how confident you were presenting your ideas and your demo of the app. I think with a little bit of work, this app can be really helpful for your community. Good job ladies! "

Your app aligns clearly with the SDG you chose because
because by reducing unnecessary purchasing of excess products you can save the environment. I think your app also tackles an even larger problem of wasteful consumer behaviors. I wonder how your app is contributing to the real economic problem. 
","
Your app could benefit from making the images of the project ot be rented a bit bigger. Most consumers like to take a closer look at the photo. Also it might be good to add the length of rental period as a factor as well. You will want to know how long you can rent the item for. 
",,"The strongest part of your pitch video was
in the beginning when you reenacted the problem your app is trying to solve. The question and answer format at the end was very informational without being boring. Great job. I think your pitch can be strengthen if you provide some statistics on wasteful spending or how much excess trash is generated by people buying things for one time use only. 
","Your business and app could solve your problem better if you can strengthen your argument on how your app is better than other services like the FB market place or craigslist. If you can make a stronger point on why this """"peer to peer"""" rental thing is helpful, that might make your business stronger. Great job!

If families cannot afford higher education, how does a search app help them? Are there many grant opportunities out there that students are not aware of? ",The demo video only provided screenshots. It would be helpful to see someone navigate the app.,"Your business plan is the strongest part of your submission. It is detailed, and evidence-based.","Very good video effects and design. Having each team member speak also showed great teamwork! At times, it was hard to understand because the speaker spoke too fast.  I suggest speaking slowly, or adding text to the video to summarize main points. ","This is a great start. The girls understand the problem but need to work on their argument for the solution to the problem. Will a search app really help students? Are there other ways to help them get more grant money? For example, teach them how to write better applications to receive a grant, or make a short list of grants specifically for poor people. "

","I could not see what was on the smart device screen until the end. This made it hard to see if the app had full function. Based on the hand movement, I think you're app has functionality but unfortunately I could not see it because the screen was too small.",Your business plan was well written and detailed. You covered most items. Scaling a business based off of donations is hard to maintain. I suggest added another revenue outlet or not using a non profit model.,Great storytelling at the beginning of the pitch. The video was very detailed but too long for a pitch video. You only want to cover the main points use the demo video and your business plan for other details.,The structure of the solution is creative but I'm not sure if it is sustainable. I would have liked to have been able to see the how the app works.
