  <h3>Official Judge Training</h3>
  <p>We will be offering two Official Judge Training Sessions that will provide information on how to use the judging platform and how to provide effective feedback to the app submissions. There will also be time to answer any questions you may have about the judging process. The trainings will take place on the below dates and times. Please take this time to register for one of the trainings:</p>
