<p>Welcome to Technovation <%= @season_year %>!</p>

<p>Your application has been approved, and you are now and Official Regional Ambassador for the <%= @season_year %> Technovation season!</p>

<p>We're so glad to work with you to bring technology and entrepreneurship to more girls across the world. We can't wait to hear about the amazing events you put on this season and to learn more about the girls participating in Technovation from your region.</p>

<p>This year we are encouraging everyone to take a few minutes to learn more about <strong>internet safety and digital citizenship</strong>. We want Technovation to be a program that fosters deep connections around the world, and we also want all of our participants to be safe and responsible. Please <%= link_to "explore these resources", @training_url %> and encourage the mentors, parents, and students you work with to explore them as well.</p>

<p>As an official Regional Ambassador (RA), you will have access to user data for students, mentors, and judges within your "region" ("country" for RAs outside of the US and "state" for those within the US) by logging into your account on <%= link_to @root_url, @root_url %>. We will be adding more features to support your events and outreach as the season progresses.</p>

<p>We will be in touch with more updates throughout the season. Thank you for your partnership and support!</p>

<p>The Technovation Team</p>
