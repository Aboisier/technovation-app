  Technovation Girls’ mission is to educate and empower young women
  to make a difference in their community using technology. In order to
  maintain a fair, safe, fun, and friendly competition for all involved,
  it is important that all participants agree to support young women in
  realizing this mission.

<p>
  You promise that all elements of your team’s <%= Season.current.year %>
  Technovation Girls submission were created solely by the students
  on your <%= Season.current.year %> Technovation team. Exception: 2020
  participants are allowed to submit the same idea (developed during 2020
  season) in 2021 - with updates, of course!
</p>

<p>
  Students may receive assistance from mentors in learning new skills
  and finding resources, but mentors will not create, design, develop or
  write any aspect of the team’s submission deliverables.

  Finally, you or your team members attest that your work contains some
  original code.
