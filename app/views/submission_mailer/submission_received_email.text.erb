Dear <%= @team.name %>,

Congratulations on completing your 2016 Technovation Submission! The Technovation Staff is extremely excited to have you as part of our alumnae community. It is an amazingly courageous feat to form your own business, and you should be proud of everything that you’ve accomplished to get to this point. In the coming weeks, industry experts will get together and review your deliverables to provide concrete feedback on how to develop the app and business fully. 

Please keep in mind that feedback is always a matter of opinion; it’s there for your reference, but ultimately this is your business and it’s completely up to you and your team where you will take these ideas.

Congratulations again!
The Technovation Staff
