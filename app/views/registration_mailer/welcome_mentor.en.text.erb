Next steps and materials to get you started...


Update your online profile on my.technovationchallenge.org

Upload a picture.

Give yourself a brief description. If you are pairing up with another mentor, make sure you mention that in your description.


Connect with a co-mentor (if desired)

Though not required, many mentors enjoy pairing up with a co-mentor who complements his/her skillset in order to spread the responsibility of supporting the team. You can recruit a friend or colleague or message another mentor through the online platform!


Connect with a Team

Through Online Platform: The majority of teams start registering in November and December. Once teams register, they can reach out to mentors through the "Find a Mentor" tab at the top of the online platform, or request that Technovation match them with a mentor. 

When connecting with teams, be sure to discuss the meeting schedule (generally 2-4 hours per week) and location (online or in person) to ensure that it fits for all parties.

Recruit a Team: You can also recruit a team in your area. Here are some recruitment tips to get you started:

Register the Team

Once you are connected with a team, one member of the team will "Create a Team.” Once the team has been created, members of the team can invite others to join or you can search for that team in the "Team Gallery" and request to join. Both you and all the students can join the team in that way. Once you've all joined, you will all be officially registered as a team and ready to go!
