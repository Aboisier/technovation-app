Welcome to Technovation!

We're thrilled that you want to learn more about programming, and that you want to use what you learn to solve a problem in your community.

First things first, make sure you have your parent or guardian's permission to participate in Technovation! They will receive an email with a consent form when you complete step one. Once they sign it, you will be registered and ready to start.

We also recommend taking some time right now to learn about internet safety and digital literacy. We want you to be safe and well-informed as your participate in online programs! Technovation will connect you with an adult mentor to support you as you develop your app. We trust our mentors and have pre-approved them to be mentors, but we still recommend that you take a few minutes to learn how to keep yourself safe when collaborating online.
