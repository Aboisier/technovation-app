<p>Congrats, <%= @first_name %>!</p>

<p>You are officially a Technovation Mentor. What does that mean? Well, you are joining a community of 1,000+ parents, educators, and professionals who also moonlight as mentors for the world's largest technology entrepreneurship program for girls. Last year, more than 6,000 girls from 78 different countries competed. 

<p>I hope you are excited! If you are nervous, that's ok. I am here to help.</p>

<p>My name is Monica, and I am the Mentor Community Manager. My role is to support you as you mentor a team of girls. I'm here to answer your questions, provide training and celebrate your success.</p>

  <li>Start learning. We created a separate <%= link_to "training site", @training_url %> to teach you how to mentor with Technovation, and it covers other exciting topics like managing millennials and facilitating youth entrepreneurship. We also partnered with experts in the field to deliver professional development courses exclusively for Technovation mentors. <%= link_to "Register for your training now", @training_url %> by using the blue "Register" button on the top right.</li>

  <li>The last step is to <%= link_to "meet other mentors on Slack", @slack_url %>. Slack is a communication tool to help us stay in contact, get questions answered quickly, and share ideas.</li>
</ol>
